## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm John, a software engineer and Rust ðŸ¦€ enthusiast based in Munich.

I'm particularly interested in things relating to simulation and cyber-physical systems.

### ðŸ“¦ Current Personal Projects 
- [boomerang](https://github.com/jondo2010/boomerang) - A pure-Rust implementation of the "Reactors" Deterministic Actor Model

### ðŸ”­ Older (but still work on time-to-time)
- [rust-ida](https://github.com/jondo2010/rust-ida) - Rust port of the Implicit Differential-Algebraic solver from the Sundials suite
- [rust-fmi](https://gitlab.com/jondo2010/rust-fmi) - A Rust interface to FMUs (Functional Mockup Units) that follow the FMI Standard
- [rust-ridc](https://gitlab.com/jondo2010/rust-ridc) - Pure Rust implementation of the Revisionist Integral Deferred Correction methods (RIDC)
